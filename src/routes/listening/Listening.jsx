				<h2>🎧 The Fourfold Path to Mastering IELTS Listening</h2>
				<p>
					<em>A journey from chaos to clarity — one playback at a time.</em>
				</p>

				<div className='stage-block'>
					<h3>
						➊ The Trial — <em>“First Encounter”</em>
					</h3>
					<p>
						The recording plays at its natural pace (1.0×).
						<br />
						No tricks, no second chances. Students dive in, grappling with
						questions as they come, learning to dance with unpredictability —
						the rawest form of understanding.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div className='stage-block'>
					<h3>
						➋ The Reckoning — <em>“Mistakes Revisited”</em>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Now at 1.2× speed, the game changes.
						<br />
						They return to their errors — not to fear them, but to
						<strong>interrogate</strong> them.
						<br />
						What slipped? Why? It’s not just about right or wrong — it’s about
						catching what your ears let slip.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div className='stage-block'>
					<h3>
						➌ The Inscription — <em>“Precision Under Pressure”</em>
					</h3>
					<p>
						At 1.2× or even 1.5× speed, they now
						<strong> transcribe</strong>.<br />
						Not guesses. Not rephrased ideas. <strong>Exact words</strong> —
						word by word.
						<br />
						This is the sculptor’s phase: shaping accuracy through discipline.
						They write what was said, not what they wish had been said.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div className='stage-block'>
					<h3>
						➍ The Flow — <em>“Effortless Absorption”</em>
					</h3>
					<p>
						The booklet closes. The pressure fades. Playback at 1.5×.
						<br />
						No pens. No answers. No chasing. Just pure
						<strong> comprehension</strong>.<br />
						They let the language flood in — following each sentence, even with
						two or three speakers weaving in and out. It’s not solving anymore —
						it’s owning the sound.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p className='conclusion-text'>
					<em>This is not mere practice.</em>
					<br />
					It’s training the ear like a musician, the mind like a fighter, and
					the intuition like a storyteller.
