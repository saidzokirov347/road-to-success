		what: [
			'Set a 20-minute timer.',
			'Answer questions in order without pausing too long.',
			'Underline only key elements (names, dates, connectors).',
			'Mark any question you’re unsure about with a ★.',
			'Do not return or recheck — this is a timed trial run.',
		],
		why: "Trains raw pacing, extracts the obvious answers, and exposes exactly where comprehension begins to blur. It's the truth test—nothing more, nothing less.",
	},
	{
		title: '➋ Stage Two – Focused Breakdown (Post-Solve)',
		what: [
			'Go back only to ★-marked and incorrect questions.',
			'Locate the specific sentence or phrase linked to the question.',
			'Ask yourself: Was the meaning misunderstood? Was a synonym missed? Was the grammar of the sentence tricky?',
			'Write a short observation about why the answer was wrong or difficult.',
		],
		why: "Exposes the exact mechanics of misunderstanding. This stage isn't about correction—it's about dissection.",
	},
	{
		title: '➌ Stage Three – Precision Refinement (Post-Solve)',
		what: [
			'Re-read any still-uncertain items.',
			'Match question language to exact phrases in the text (use arrows or highlights).',
			'Trace reference words (e.g., it, this, those) to their clear subject.',
			'For matching/headings, isolate the central sentence in each paragraph.',
			'Change answer only if logic is clearly anchored in the passage.',
		],
		why: 'Builds discipline in close reading. This is where answers are no longer guesses—they are proofs.',

		title: '➍ Stage Four – Structural Recall & Logical Reconstruction',
		what: [
			'A. Chronological Structuring: draw boxes for paragraphs, summarize with arrows → ← ↔ ↘',
			'B. Idea Grouping: visually connect theme-paragraphs',
			'C. Final Summary: write a full sentence about the flow of the passage',
		],
		why: 'Shifts focus from micro-analysis to full-text awareness. This step prepares the mind for speed with clarity.',
	},
